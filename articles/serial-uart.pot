"Usually the only option to support these kind of boards is to use a distinct "
"IRQ for each port. For example, if your CPU board has an on-board "
"<filename>COM1</filename> port (aka <filename>sio0</filename>–I/O address "
"0x3F8 and IRQ 4) and you have an extension board with two UARTs, you will "
"commonly need to configure them as <filename>COM2</filename> (aka "
"<filename>sio1</filename>–I/O address 0x2F8 and IRQ 3), and the third port "
"(aka <filename>sio2</filename>) as I/O 0x3E8 and IRQ 5. Obviously this is a "
"waste of IRQ resources, as it should be basically possible to run both "
"extension board ports using a single IRQ with the <literal>COM_MULTIPORT</"
