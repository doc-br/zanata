"The scope of this article will be limited to solid state disk devices made "
"from flash memory. Flash memory is a solid state memory (no moving parts) "
"that is non-volatile (the memory maintains data even after all power sources "
"have been disconnected). Flash memory can withstand tremendous physical "
"shock and is reasonably fast (the flash memory solutions covered in this "
"article are slightly slower than a EIDE hard disk for write operations, and "
"much faster for read operations). One very important aspect of flash memory, "
"the ramifications of which will be discussed later in this article, is that "
"each sector has a limited rewrite capacity. You can only write, erase, and "
"write again to a sector of flash memory a certain number of times before the "
"sector becomes permanently unusable. Although many flash memory products "
"automatically map bad blocks, and although some even distribute write "
"operations evenly throughout the unit, the fact remains that there exists a "
"limit to the amount of writing that can be done to the device. Competitive "
"units have between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 writes per sector in their "
"specification. This figure varies due to the temperature of the environment."

"artículo son un poco más lentas que un disco duro EIDE en operaciones de "
"escritura y mucho más rápidos en operaciones de lectura). Un aspecto muy "
