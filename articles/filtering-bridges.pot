"Now it is time to create your own file with custom firewall rules, in order "

"only once, not twice as is normally the case; in fact they are filtered only "

"limitation is that you are restricted to use only <option>pass</option> or "
"<option>drop</option> commands for packets filtered by a bridge. "
"Sophisticated things like <option>divert</option>, <option>forward</option> "

"New in FreeBSD 4.0, is the concept of stateful filtering. This is a big "
