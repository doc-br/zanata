"The historical BSD had a monolithic startup script, <filename>/etc/rc</"
"filename>. It was invoked by <citerefentry><refentrytitle>init</"
"refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> at system boot time "
"and performed all userland tasks required for multi-user operation: checking "
"and mounting file systems, setting up the network, starting daemons, and so "
"on. The precise list of tasks was not the same in every system; admins "
"needed to customize it. With few exceptions, <filename>/etc/rc</filename> "
"had to be modified, and true hackers liked it."

"The real problem with the monolithic approach was that it provided no "
"control over the individual components started from <filename>/etc/rc</"
"filename>. For instance, <filename>/etc/rc</filename> could not restart a "
"single daemon. The system admin had to find the daemon process by hand, kill "
"it, wait until it actually exited, then browse through <filename>/etc/rc</"
"filename> for the flags, and finally type the full command line to start the "
"daemon again. The task would become even more difficult and prone to errors "
"if the service to restart consisted of more than one daemon or demanded "
"additional actions. In a few words, the single script failed to fulfil what "
"scripts are for: to make the system admin's life easier."

"Later there was an attempt to split out some parts of <filename>/etc/rc</"
"filename> for the sake of starting the most important subsystems separately. "
"The notorious example was <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> to bring up "
"networking. It did allow for accessing the network from single-user mode, "
"but it did not integrate well into the automatic startup process because "
"parts of its code needed to interleave with actions essentially unrelated to "
"networking. That was why <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> mutated into "
"<filename>/etc/rc.network</filename>. The latter was no longer an ordinary "
"script; it comprised of large, tangled <citerefentry><refentrytitle>sh</"
"refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> functions called from "
"<filename>/etc/rc</filename> at different stages of system startup. However, "
"as the startup tasks grew diverse and sophisticated, the <quote>quasi-"

"Without a clean and well-designed framework, the startup scripts had to bend "
"over backwards to satisfy the needs of rapidly developing BSD-based "

"Thus BSD <filename>rc.d</filename> was born. Its acknowledged fathers were "
"Luke Mewburn and the NetBSD community. Later it was imported into FreeBSD. "
"Its name refers to the location of system scripts for individual services, "

"The basic ideas behind BSD <filename>rc.d</filename> are <emphasis>fine "
"modularity</emphasis> and <emphasis>code reuse</emphasis>. <emphasis>Fine "
"modularity</emphasis> means that each basic <quote>service</quote> such as a "
"system daemon or primitive startup task gets its own "
"<citerefentry><refentrytitle>sh</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></"
"citerefentry> script able to start the service, stop it, reload it, check "
"its status. A particular action is chosen by the command-line argument to "
"the script. The <filename>/etc/rc</filename> script still drives system "
"startup, but now it merely invokes the smaller scripts one by one with the "
"<option>start</option> argument. It is easy to perform shutdown tasks as "
"well by running the same set of scripts with the <option>stop</option> "
"argument, which is done by <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename>. Note how "
"closely this follows the Unix way of having a set of small specialized "
"tools, each fulfilling its task as well as possible. <emphasis>Code reuse</"
"emphasis> means that common operations are implemented as "
"<citerefentry><refentrytitle>sh</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></"
"citerefentry> functions and collected in <filename>/etc/rc.subr</filename>. "
"Now a typical script can be just a few lines' worth of "
"<citerefentry><refentrytitle>sh</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></"
"citerefentry> code. Finally, an important part of the <filename>rc.d</"
"filename> framework is <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rcorder</"
"refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>, which helps "
"<filename>/etc/rc</filename> to run the small scripts orderly with respect "
"to dependencies between them. It can help <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</"
"filename>, too, because the proper order for the shutdown sequence is "
"opposite to that of startup."
