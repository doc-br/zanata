"The boot process is an extremely machine-dependent activity. Not only must "

"multiple types of booting on the same architecture. For example, a directory "

"supported architectures. In the x86-specific <filename>i386</filename> "

"<filename>mbr</filename> (Master Boot Record), <filename>gpt</filename> "
"(<acronym>GUID</acronym> Partition Table), and <filename>efi</filename> "

"Note that the client's environment include a stack segment selector and "
"stack pointer (registers <literal>%ss</literal> and <literal>%esp</"
"literal>). Indeed, once the <acronym>TR</acronym> is loaded with the "
"appropriate stack segment selector (instruction <literal>ltr</literal>), the "
"stack pointer is calculated and pushed onto the stack along with the stack's "
"segment selector. Next, the value <literal>0x202</literal> is pushed onto "
"the stack; it is the value that the EFLAGS will get when control is passed "
"to the client. Also, the User Mode code segment selector and the client's "
"entry point are pushed. Recall that this entry point is patched in the "
"<acronym>BTX</acronym> header at link time. Finally, segment selectors "
"(stored in register <literal>%ecx</literal>) for the segment registers "
"<literal>%gs, %fs, %ds and %es</literal> are pushed onto the stack, along "
"with the value at <literal>%edx</literal> (<literal>0xa000</literal>). Keep "
"in mind the various values that have been pushed onto the stack (they will "
"be popped out shortly). Next, values for the remaining general purpose "
"registers are also pushed onto the stack (note the <literal>loop</literal> "
"that pushes the value <literal>0</literal> seven times). Now, values will be "
"started to be popped out of the stack. First, the <literal>popa</literal> "
"instruction pops out of the stack the latest seven values pushed. They are "
"stored in the general purpose registers in order <literal>%edi, %esi, %ebp, "
"%ebx, %edx, %ecx, %eax</literal>. Then, the various segment selectors pushed "
"are popped into the various segment registers. Five values still remain on "
"the stack. They are popped when the <literal>iret</literal> instruction is "
"executed. This instruction first pops the value that was pushed from the "
"<acronym>BTX</acronym> header. This value is a pointer to <filename>boot2</"
"filename>'s entry point. It is placed in the register <literal>%eip</"
"literal>, the instruction pointer register. Next, the segment selector for "
"the User Code Segment is popped and copied to register <literal>%cs</"
"literal>. Remember that this segment's privilege level is 3, the least "
"privileged level. This means that we must provide values for the stack of "
"this privilege level. This is why the processor, besides further popping the "
"value for the EFLAGS register, does two more pops out of the stack. These "
"values go to the stack pointer (<literal>%esp</literal>) and the stack "
"segment (<literal>%ss</literal>). Now, execution continues at "
"<literal>boot0</literal>'s entry point."

"On most <trademark class=\"registered\">UNIX</trademark> systems, "
"<literal>root</literal> has omnipotent power. This promotes insecurity. If "
"an attacker gained <literal>root</literal> on a system, he would have every "
"function at his fingertips. In FreeBSD there are sysctls which dilute the "
"power of <literal>root</literal>, in order to minimize the damage caused by "
"an attacker. Specifically, one of these functions is called <literal>secure "
"levels</literal>. Similarly, another function which is present from FreeBSD "
"4.0 and onward, is a utility called <citerefentry><refentrytitle>jail</"
"refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>. <application>Jail</"
"application> chroots an environment and sets certain restrictions on "
"processes which are forked within the <application>jail</application>. For "
"example, a jailed process cannot affect processes outside the "
"<application>jail</application>, utilize certain system calls, or inflict "
"any damage on the host environment."

"Access control entry points permit policy modules to influence access "
"control decisions made by the kernel. Generally, although not always, "
"arguments to an access control entry point will include one or more "
"authorizing credentials, information (possibly including a label) for any "
"other objects involved in the operation. An access control entry point may "
"return 0 to permit the operation, or an <citerefentry><refentrytitle>errno</"
"refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> error value. The "
"results of invoking the entry point across various registered policy modules "
"will be composed as follows: if all modules permit the operation to succeed, "
"success will be returned. If one or modules returns a failure, a failure "
"will be returned. If more than one module returns a failure, the errno value "
"to return to the user will be selected using the following precedence, "

"Device requests (control transfers) to the default endpoints are special. "
